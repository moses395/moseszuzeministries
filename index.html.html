      <h2>1. Anger</h2>
      <p>
        Anger makes us lose focus and control over our actions. As a christian
        we need to be always aware of things that makes go angry. Jesus is the
        center of our life, therefore Jesus must be our example on how we react
        through our situations and temptation. Lets pray God give me the power
        to overcome every spirit on anger in my life in Jesus Name.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Lust</h2>
      <p>
        Lust is the completely opposite of love. Lust is selfish, pride,
        envious. A christian must watch out of this infection because it drains
        out the life of a person and render useless everything somone has worked
        for. Prayer: God set me free from the spirit of lust and give me the
        grace to follow you. Amen
      </p>
      <h2>Laziness</h2>
      <p>
        Every Christian need to have the desire to work hard. Being lazy is not
        bibical. Each and every day you need to pray, read the bible and find
        something to do to support finacially. Being lazy is not an excuse of
        being spiritual. you can be spiritual and working at the same time.
        Prayer: God help me to overcome laziness in my life. In Jesus Name. Amen
